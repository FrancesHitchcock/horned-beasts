# Horned Beasts - Tech Educators React Project

## 17/07/23

This was an introductory React project created with create-react-app. The project was built solo by Frances Hitchcock. The following skills and concepts were used:

- React components
- props
- keys
- mapping over data to render components from an array of objects
- responsiveness using Flexbox

## 18/07/23

- JSON data file was added and data imported into Main.js
- Responsiveness added using Grid
- functionality added to HornedBeast.js to add likes when image is clicked
- Dark mode toggles when h1 header is clicked.

## 19/07/23

- Added modal functionality so if user clicks on image the beast is displayed in a modal.

## 20/07/23

- Refactored code so entire beast object is passed as a prop rather than individual properties.
- Add functionality so the user can filter by number of horns.
